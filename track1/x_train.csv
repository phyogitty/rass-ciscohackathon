It should come from the manager.It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for thereunit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasizethat it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changesif you need to.Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners andrefrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a formto use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want thisinformation plus we need it for our records.

In attendance were Ken Lay,the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and hisideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of nextweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based onmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials JeffDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding ourproposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situationwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoingcommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities togo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than whatthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has morework to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  Hetalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retaillevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for thebenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which hewould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market orientedsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fixthe problem by '02 and provide some political cover.included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemedinterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting agoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilitiesto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rateanalysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issuesincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gaspurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to findingsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" ofgeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers thatthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  Thiswas a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plusbasis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation inCalifornia.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would morewidely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west foraddtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plantmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service atany one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hearmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should beable to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We madesome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buysome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generationthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and controlapproach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of thedeal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of theforward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.

What isgoing on?#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up withemail and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff knowthat he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see theproperty.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can showthem around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay rightnow.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meetbut I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wadecontinue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve theproperty's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better andbetter, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  Itis hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people movein that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  Irealize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor andyour daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and beworking in the office or on the property during office unless you are runningan errand for the property.I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at thistime.

1854,"George,I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still havethe concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of ourproject are too high.  I have gathered more information that support myconcerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost aroundUnit Cost, Site work, &builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 millionLand                      1.15Interim Financing               .85Common Areas                     .80Total                         $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unableto get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class Aproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos canproduce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments forlocation and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognizethat Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental ratesthat are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do notbelieve that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement thatwe cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon todiscussalternatives.Phillip"

Forwhat periods?What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of moneyand time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by firstasking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong likeleaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean theapartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthlyinspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.

1602,"Lucy,The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  Itshould read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.=e6-g6.3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column widthis too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside theletter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up tothis sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.Phillip"

Yourearlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer tothis question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file andsend it back.Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.

1,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time."

The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now.If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.

1095,"Lucy,Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What isgoing on?#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up withemail and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff knowthat he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see theproperty.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can showthem around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay rightnow.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meetbut I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wadecontinue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve theproperty's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better andbetter, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  Itis hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people movein that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  Irealize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor andyour daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and beworking in the office or on the property during office unless you are runningan errand for the property.I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at thistime.  We can look at again later in the year.I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.Phillip"

Can the loan amount be adjusted based on new costs estimates.  What w=ill happen at closing?  Is the major problem with the appraisal that since =the land was only appraised at 1,120,000 we would be required to contribute=an additional 180,000 in equity?  If so, that is not good.You mentioned that the we are firm on the construction numbers given to me =previously.

Also, I would really appreciate a schedule of tru=e costs and expected loan.Thank you,Phillip-----Original Message-----Phillip,I am trying to press Bank to get the Deed of Trust to you. I am in a balanc=ing act between moving on the construction and holding until the lien is pe=rfected. I talked to Cheerie and she said the person in Dallas is trying to=get it done today, however, she may not finish it out today, which means i=t will be sent for Thursday morning delivery to a sister Ticor office for s=ignature and recording.  Have they told you any of this? Or do I need to ma=ke sure you know when, where, and how as soon as I know.I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal an=d gave the information to us over the phone.  The appraised value as built =is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695.  The problem is the Land Value is $=1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in Ja=nuary.  Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top=of this showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to s=how an increase in value?.  I am tending to think we are going to reduce ou=r overall loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost =and some other small adjustments to costs. This would reduce our overall de=bt and resultant equity requirement. The main difference in committing to a=greater loan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be o=ut of balance in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk be=ing short and needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. I have be=en working on this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effec=ts each change will have on your equity and return.We are firm on the construction numbers given to you previously and we have=had a number of additional costs which we have been able to absorb in the =overall construction budget.  The biggest is the detention pond dredging wh=ich has gone up in cost.  The only area left to work through is the foundat=ion/concrete number and I am confident we will hit that one on the mark. Th=us, overall I am comfortable with the Hard Cost numbers at this point.I am attempting to get with Irwin and Cheerie and seeing if we can get the =final Doc's put together. Have'nt been able to get a meeting yet.I just got interrupted in another meeting.  Let me know if there are any qu=estions today."
2019,"Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the samelevel of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. Yousay that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. Ijust did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel costwas about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and wecan discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of thetrue custom home level but should be achievable with good management.Richard MorganManager, Green Building ProgramAustin Energy721 Barton Springs Rd.Austin, TX 78704-1194Ph. 512.505.3709Fax 512.505.3711e-mail richard.morgan@austinenergy.com-----Original Message-----Richard,I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building withSIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I candecide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprintscompleted.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio thatis also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay withinthat budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick builthouse.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of aradiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the sameenergy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke toa sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additionalcosts for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would helpme construct the best home for the money.

Enron stock is now lower than when Ijoined the company out of business school.  I imagine there are quite a fewnot so happy people these days.  We can relate somewhat over here at NPWwith a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago).  Knowingyou, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you downmuch.

189,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/28/2000Laird DyerMike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regardingasset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing tolisten to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges toprotect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentialityagreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enableus to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholdervalue by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and byreducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via aweather product.As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue othercandidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategyto ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate ouropportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as weimplement our strategy in California.Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an assetmanagement deal that we should approach?

2553,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/17/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that theconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than ourstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairlysure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detachedgarages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.- winmail.dat"

1761,"Steve,I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  Ifyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards salesabove monthly index without enough consideration of futurereplacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should beinjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.This creates a shortage in later months.2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meetdemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in orderto fill storage?2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away toomuch gas from Socal's system.I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting theirown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas thantheir injection capablity, but injected far less.3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to shortterm prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the majorLDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floatingrate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers marketand theconsumer has benefitted.Call me if you need any more input.Phillip"

In attendance were Ken Lay,the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and hisideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of nextweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based onmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials JeffDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding ourproposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situationwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoingcommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities togo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than whatthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has morework to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  Hetalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retaillevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for thebenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which hewould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market orientedsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fixthe problem by '02 and provide some political cover.included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemedinterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting agoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilitiesto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rateanalysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issuesincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gaspurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to findingsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" ofgeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers thatthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  Thiswas a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plusbasis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation inCalifornia.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would morewidely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west foraddtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plantmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service atany one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hearmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should beable to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We madesome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buysome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generationthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and controlapproach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of thedeal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of theforward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today."

As he did not have the funds to take on theland himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would liketo proceed and develop the property.My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I wouldalso like to compare construction and development services between what youcan do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems tobe in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architecturalwork to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer isQuattro Consultants out of Buda.

The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now.If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is notyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I willknow more on this question later today.Sincerely,George W.

646,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/08/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><invest@bga.com>I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lotduplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a muchlower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are dueto a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one ofthe duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) therent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if wewere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroomunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.Sincerely,George W.

1651,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Callwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.Sincerely,George RichardsPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC- winmail.dat"

1010,"Gentlemen,Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done todate.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property isstill in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lotand is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed atopographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun tocoordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on thesmaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is goingto fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged tocomplete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which$14,000 are due now for work completed.We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred bythe original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we cancontinue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo'snumber is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly andask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your calland he was fine with that.Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by KippFlores can be used.Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left veryoptimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas aboutmoving this project forward.Phillip"

366,"Jacques,The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry mightobject to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance theconstruction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costsof the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered theloan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount ofequity that would be required.Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items arein a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speakingdirectly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear onwhat is the best way to proceed with these consultants.The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do weneed to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  andgive consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.Phillip"
2367,"Renee,I would like to have a meeting to go over the payment methodology.  Scott Neal and Tom Martin would like to attend as well.  This afternoon at 2 PM or later would work for us.  Please let me know what time we could meet.Thank you,Phillip-----Original Message-----Phillip,This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.Thanks,Renee-----Original Message-----Renee,Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.""

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of whichcurrent unpaid invoices due total $37,325.Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into thisproject for more than five months and have completed most of the major designand other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm ofour size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed orrejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.?Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on apercentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based onyour prior valuation of our time.?

For thesecond, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 peryear, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of thesevaluations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes theforfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, inthe hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of futureprojects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 permonth to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.?

Also, if you want me toget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know andI'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygatecurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of$235,019.(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change youroverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affectssomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)GDP-Kingsgate.Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see fivedifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be forwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as aQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means isthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transportlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have asystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seemsthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's thedetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where itappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may bean operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollarimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just incase there's something you want to do about it.

916,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/25/2001Ray Alvarez@ENRONPhil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closeddoors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners thenamong FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely thatthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in largepart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at whichthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairmanbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment oranswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert hadPrice caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reducedemand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they wouldexport California's problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a prettystrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissionerout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda andif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off theagenda.  Hope this info helps.  RayPhillip K Allen@ECTAre there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixedprice gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?"
2252,"Jeff,JP Morgan is comparing a file of calculated daily curve shift to actual P&L.  Gas P&L for 2001 was 1.2 Billion but the theoretical curve shift was -13 million.  This is from a file assembled by David Port which is attached.  The biggest difference is 9/14 ($500 million).  This is probably money coming out of reserves.  Besides that day there are many smaller differences.  Can you help me by pulling the P&L packets from some of the larger days?

1652,"Liane,As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt tomanipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered themarketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At thetime of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades toreport into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out ofline with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed fromSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades fromEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokeragefirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for atrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gasdaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greaterthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September andOctober gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces thatare dramatically different.I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, thetrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able todetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades areoutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid inestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from thecalculation of index.It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which toconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact meanytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen"

In attendance were Ken Lay,the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and hisideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of nextweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based onmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials JeffDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding ourproposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situationwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoingcommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities togo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than whatthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has morework to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  Hetalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retaillevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for thebenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which hewould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market orientedsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fixthe problem by '02 and provide some political cover.included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemedinterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting agoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilitiesto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rateanalysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issuesincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gaspurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to findingsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" ofgeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers thatthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  Thiswas a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plusbasis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation inCalifornia.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would morewidely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west foraddtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plantmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service atany one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hearmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should beable to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We madesome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buysome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generationthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and controlapproach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of thedeal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of theforward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.

2789,"Jacques,I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items ofvalue and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able touse everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey,appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 inextensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land likeearnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and Ididn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clearthis up.Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership andthe risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand,conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it wasclean.  What is your inclination?Call as soon as you have a chance to review.Phillip"

The builder in San Marcos believed theplan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomesacross the street have a serious parking problem.

1045,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 02/21/2001Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in theaddition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate willcosts at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costshave been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more thansufficient, but there will be additional updates.The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&Ntotal of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit andoffice is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in asa rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanentmortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for theconstruction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when thisloan is obtained.Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, theconstruction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.George W.

490,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/29/2001George,Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and buildersprofit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would berecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 wouldbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as theinvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentionedearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you aspart of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit fromhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase1 complete in November)+5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule-5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, butcould be as favorable as 55/45.

2392,"Pam please review.  I don't want to misrepresent your position to Greg.Greg,After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=f Enron Corp. common stock.There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".=This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=ction 6.3.The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=esRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,65810% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 sharesI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. ==20In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=same issue.

If there is a creative way tostructure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that hasbeen mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce theequity required.

1058,"Jaques,After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have differentdefinitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of asuperintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to thirdparty subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management""fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would bepaid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finallythe builders profit of 1.4 million.Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers outof the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, ifthey are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in additionto the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have beenin the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates andthe superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction managementfee is included.George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I willreview and let you know what I think.The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.

I was going for a simplefarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets,maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagansuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want tokeep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing theleftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.  Thatmight look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porchwouldbe smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead andhave the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.

2881,"Jeff,I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are severalreasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, thelarge cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyerare the three biggest concerns.What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over thebuyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come dueuntil September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold theproperty.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to makethe deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinanceis pushing too far.Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day theearnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn't enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representativesin June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncPower Plants(This article was originally published Wednesday)By Jessica BertholdOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRESLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) saidWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped bysome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimatereasons.The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's powergrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California PublicUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all powerplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW forunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions CreditsThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict's"" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUCDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

2285,"-----Original Message-----Phillip;These are just what I started with.  I have not really fully looked at eachspreadsheet for error in logic or other.I notice the primary difference between the existing projects and newprojects is that on an existing project you have to had value to be able toincrease the cash flow to be able to finance out of them to be able toachieve a decent IRR. Thus you have to pay as little as possible, increasethe cash flow (i.e.-renovations), to compete with the quality of newconstruction.  And no I am not making numbers up nor am I sold on newconstruction strictly.  I just am working on the best look as possible.I look forward to discussing this further.Sincerely,Greg Thorse- Proforma.Sutters Mill.xls- Proforma.Sage Crossing.xls- Proforma.Waters At Bluff Springs.xls- Proforma.South Park.xls- Proforma.Sunrise Canyon.xls- Proforma.SeaBreeze.xls- Proforma.Harvard Place.xls"

Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.Phillip"

The other two are new.The Roma is like buying a savings account. It would be paid off in 10years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonuskicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease incomeafter it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cashon cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma.We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us knowif you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they willlast long.

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn't enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representativesin June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncPower Plants(This article was originally published Wednesday)By Jessica BertholdOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRESLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp.

The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions CreditsThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict's"" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUCDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

376,"Jacques,I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items ofvalue and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able touse everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey,appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 inextensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land likeearnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and Ididn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clearthis up.Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership andthe risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand,conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it wasclean.  What is your inclination?Call as soon as you have a chance to review.Phillip"

Temperaturescould climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part ofthe morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expirationthe market had pretty much dried up.""Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the mainreason for the decline in spot market prices.Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to theNew York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per millionBritish thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. SinceMonday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecastsindicated reduced utility load requirements.In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies theynormally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weatherforecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the$67.00-$75.00 range.

Natural gas prices were a large factor in recentelectricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-firedgeneration to meet increased weather-related demand.Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an averageof 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million Britishthermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an averageof 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've gotpeople coming to their senses,"" one trader said.

Traded volume fell4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely riseby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-term contracts.Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner amegawatt-hour.Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, althoughexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producersto meet the increased demand, other traders said.Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who usedtoday's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.-Nick Livingstone=0F$- daily.pdf"

1853,"George,I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have theconcerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our projectare too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5Unit Cost, Site work, &builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 millionLand      1.15Interim Financing     .85Common Areas       .80Total     $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable toget comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class Aproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can producethe same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and theseasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood iscurrently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer tothe appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the marketwill sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablelyincrease to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that wecannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.Phillip"
2660,is this still an issue?
2395,"Mike & Tony,Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.Phillip Allen713-463-8626pallen70@hotmail.com"

1335,"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."
2372,"Mery,This sounds better than the limitations you were describing in the meeting.  We should be able to work with this.Phillip-----Original Message-----Phillip,The purpose of this e-mail is to explain the results of our discussionswith the technical team after our meeting with you. We need to get yourapproval of the points listed below so that we can begin building theapplication.We can have the Position and P&L Reports show the results of the learner'sdecisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward intime with wrong answers. This will achieve our goal of giving the learners""more rope"" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. In order toThe feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday'smeeting. We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P&L andpositions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previousperiod. We will not, for example, be able to say things like ""InNovember, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdrawgas. What you should have done was...""We cannot save the P&L and position numbers. This means that if thelearner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiencesa computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need tostart over at time period one.We cannot have the learner calculate P&L on storage costs,transportation costs, or hedging instruments. This is because the rightanswer and the available answer choices would have to depend on thedecisions the learner has made. Now that the learner can go down anypath he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, andthe right answers are variable. I believe these tasks will be actuallybetter if we don't have the learner calculate P&L because he has alreadycalculated P&L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios andconversion and arbitrage scenarios. Furthermore, the type of feedback wewould have to give about specific P&L numbers will not flow well withthe high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in thistask.We cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq frameworkdoes not support the downloading of data into external applications. Thetechnical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our currentdevelopment budget. We can, however, do some calculations for the learneron the screen. We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make themistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices.If you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of dayWednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of thissimulation. I would be happy to discuss these points with you; please letme know if you would like to set up a meeting.Thank you.MeryThis message is for the designated recipient only and may containprivileged or confidential information.

We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week[IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.This message has been sent to pallen@enron.com, provided free of charge and free of obligation.

915,"Ned,Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need forthis storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the currentsummer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were madecapacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection andwithdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60existed at the time of this bid.Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on aboveI am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.

2772,"Greg,Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf(rentable)What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2%overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.Why is profit only 4%?Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit toboost loan amount but not a real cost?Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Whoreceives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope putsNOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40%expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coveragewould only be 1.16.Talk to you this afternoon.Phillip"

985,"Jacques,The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry mightobject to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance theconstruction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costsof the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered theloan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount ofequity that would be required.Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items arein a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speakingdirectly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear onwhat is the best way to proceed with these consultants.The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do weneed to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  andgive consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.Phillip"

1029,"George,I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have theconcerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our projectare too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5Unit Cost, Site work, &builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 millionLand      1.15Interim Financing     .85Common Areas       .80Total     $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable toget comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class Aproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can producethe same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and theseasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood iscurrently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer tothe appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the marketwill sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablelyincrease to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that wecannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.Phillip"

2694,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holdingthe business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal businessmeetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip iseven desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to tryand stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is workingand what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quietjust waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in around table discussion format.My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat andjet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time."

468,"Jeff,I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are severalreasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, thelarge cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyerare the three biggest concerns.What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over thebuyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come dueuntil September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold theproperty.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to makethe deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinanceis pushing too far.Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day theearnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the NewBraunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will getstarted on the list.Email or call  me later today.Phillip"

As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all weeklong.""Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000megawatts through Friday.Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause forthe dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned toservice today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected tohit the grid tomorrow.Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New YorkPower Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2nuclear power facilities.The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion ofa refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 atfull power following unplanned maintenance.

Volatility in the contract today stemmed from oppositionfrom another trading house, which bought the contract, supportingprice levels, traders said.Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather wasexpected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower productioncosts because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday afterlast trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gasfutures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15pence a thermal unit.

1146,"George,Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and buildersprofit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would berecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 wouldbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as theinvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentionedearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you aspart of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit fromhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase1 complete in November)+5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule-5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, butcould be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedulemust be discussed and agreed upon.Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626Phillip"

In preparation for that meeting we would like togain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What aretypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your maincontacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving ourcontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probablyhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with thecommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from theircommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of monthindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  Thatrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation oftheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatlyappreciated.Thanks,Laird"

408,"George,I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have theconcerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our projectare too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5Unit Cost, Site work, &builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 millionLand      1.15Interim Financing     .85Common Areas       .80Total     $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable toget comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class Aproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can producethe same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and theseasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood iscurrently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer tothe appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the marketwill sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablelyincrease to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that wecannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.Phillip"

The structure they are looking for is a firm physicalsale at a NYMEX related price.  There is a very good chance that they will dothis all with one party.  We are definitely being considered as that party.Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the fewproducers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River.What would be your bid for this gas?Tyrell Harrison@ECT

As you can see evenreducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would onlygenerate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled aboutsuch a low return.

760,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 06/12/2000It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  TheWSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposesthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, butthere can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual""generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule theirgeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then youwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern californiamunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simplyschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having saidall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives onthe generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  Whilethey don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number isbetter than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on theload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this withothers up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gasdemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small theUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginalconsumer then it is obviously a different story.Let's talk."
1050,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 02/21/2001Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in theaddition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate willcosts at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costshave been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more thansufficient, but there will be additional updates.The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&Ntotal of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit andoffice is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in asa rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanentmortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for theconstruction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when thisloan is obtained.Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, theconstruction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.George W.

177,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/30/2000Phillip--I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strangeto me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not bean issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this isO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me toget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know andI'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygatecurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of$235,019.(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change youroverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affectssomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)GDP-Kingsgate.Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see fivedifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be forwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as aQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means isthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transportlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have asystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seemsthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's thedetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where itappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may bean operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollarimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just incase there's something you want to do about it.

Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada =and slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline =in Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Eu=rope. Optical Inter-city revenues were down sharply in the United States, E=urope and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia.

Photon=ic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter co=mpared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was l=argely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Inter-cit=y solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000.   Other revenues decline=d 29 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Su=bstantial growth in Global Professional Services in Europe and Asia, and st=rong growth in the United States, was more than offset by considerable decl=ines in legacy voice solutions for corporations across all regions and wire=less OEM revenues in most regions.   Commensurate with its announcement on =October 2, 2001 to align its resources around three businesses (Metro Netwo=rks, Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks), Nortel Networks wil=l evolve its financial reporting to reflect the new organization beginning =in the fourth quarter of 2001.   Geographic revenues for the third quarter =of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 decreased 54 percent in the Uni=ted States, 53 percent in Canada and 30 percent outside the United States a=nd Canada.         Nine-Month Results    For the first nine months of 2001,=revenues from continuing operations were US$14.06 billion compared to US$1=9.75 billion for the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuin=g operations(a) for the first nine months of 2001 was US$4.01 billion, or U=S$1.26 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$1.57 bill=ion, or US$0.51 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in=2000. Including the net loss from discontinued access solutions operations=, Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions=and divestitures, one-time gains and charges, and the write down of intang=ible assets, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss of US$25.48 billion, or US=$8.01 per common share, for the first nine months of 2001.         Spending=Management    The Company continued to make rapid progress to reduce its c=ost structure. Compared to the Company's year-end 2000 cost structure, excl=usive of incremental provisions and charges, the Company's cost structure a=t the end of the third quarter of 2001 is lower by approximately US$1 billi=on.         Gross Margin    Gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was =approximately 1 percent reflecting incremental charges of approximately US$=750 million related to excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the exp=ected decrease in sales due to the continued downturn in the market. Exclud=ing the impact of these incremental and other contract-related charges, gro=ss margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 25 percent, compa=red to approximately 26 percent in the second quarter of 2001.         Expe=nses    Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses in the third =quarter of 2001 were US$1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market ad=justments and further decline in some of our of customers' financial condit=ion resulted in incremental provisions of US$767 million in the quarter rel=ated to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental prov=isions in both periods, SG?expenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared =to second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US$190 million.   Res=earch and development (""R&D"") expenses were US$808 million in the third qua=rter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments t=o drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the eliminat=ion of spending in all other areas. Compared to the second quarter of 2001,=R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US$100=million, reflecting the impact of restructuring and streamlining operation=s.   The financial results of Nortel Networks Limited(b) (""NNL""), Nortel Ne=tworks Corporation's principal operating subsidiary, are fully consolidated=into Nortel Networks results. NNL has preferred shares which are publicly =traded in Canada. For the third quarter of 2001, NNL took a restructuring c=harge of US$793 million (pre-tax) associated with the completion of workfor=ce reductions and the closure of certain facilities related to business str=eamlining; and recorded US$207 million (pre-tax) primarily related to the a=pproximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of the Photonic=s Components business. All such amounts are included in the consolidated No=rtel Networks amounts described above.

2849,"Jaques,After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have differentdefinitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of asuperintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to thirdparty subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management""fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would bepaid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finallythe builders profit of 1.4 million.Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers outof the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, ifthey are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in additionto the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have beenin the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates andthe superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction managementfee is included.George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I willreview and let you know what I think.The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable tothe 3 out 4 approval process.Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  onlytrue costs + 1.4 million.Phillip"

Patti held together the schedulinggroup for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Pattiwas always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, shewould be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All thetraders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This informationhas been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and sizeof the west desk positions.Please call to discuss cash award.Phillip"

2903,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/29/2001George,Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and buildersprofit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would berecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 wouldbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as theinvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentionedearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you aspart of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit fromhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase1 complete in November)+5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule-5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, butcould be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedulemust be discussed and agreed upon.Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626Phillip"

No hand-outs were provided.Calculation of Receipt Point CapacityTopock  540 mmcf/dEhrenberg 1250 mmcf/dNeedles 800 mmcf/dWheeler 800 mmcf/dNew Receipt PointsKramer Junction 200 mmcf/dHector Rd 50 mmcf/dBoth will be available around Feb 1Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows CalculationCurrently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.New Calculation, Changes and DisplayBased on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.OFO DeclarationName changes from overnominationCan declare before any CycleProvide 2 hour noticePost on Gas SelectShow OFO Calculation on Gas SelectWindowsReason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into systemCalculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO'sNow customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.Scheduling Changes-Nov 1Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycleCopy confirmed nomsAll noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.2 Hour NoticeSocal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFONominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.Use Elapsed Pro-Rata RulesExpected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cutCycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cutCylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cutWindows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled VolumesCycle 1                                    Cycle 2Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.Winter Balancing RulesEffective Nov 1-March 31No changes.All customers must comply.Minimum delivery requirements50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)70% of daily usage depending on storage level70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min90% of daily usage depending on storage level90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.

The principal change is in theaddition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate willcosts at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costshave been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more thansufficient, but there will be additional updates.The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&Ntotal of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit andoffice is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in asa rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanentmortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for theconstruction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when thisloan is obtained.Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, theconstruction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.George W.

This is a large deal being led  by the Gulf orig team. that may have some rockies production transactions included in them.BT-----Original Message-----Hunter, Scott, Tom & Barry,For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001.Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity.OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions.In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration.  Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings.This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas packages.The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please contact me at X-36784."

Patti held together the schedulinggroup for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Pattiwas always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, shewould be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All thetraders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This informationhas been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and sizeof the west desk positions.Please call to discuss cash award.Phillip"

After broker fees and a title policy, Iwould net around $20K cash.You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 orhigher with the terms described in the 1st email.

319,"Johnnie,Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.Please email your cost estimates when complete.Thank you,Phillip Allen"

839,"Folks,I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime anddevelopment of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that Ithink will be interesting to the group.I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   avery thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....limeand clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The bookcovers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 yearslearning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that havelasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and goodbackground information for sustainable builder folks.Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.Moore</A>Regards,Harry Francis"

1959,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/30/2000Phillip--I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strangeto me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not bean issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this isO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me toget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know andI'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygatecurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of$235,019.(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change youroverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affectssomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)GDP-Kingsgate.Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see fivedifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be forwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as aQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means isthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transportlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have asystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seemsthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's thedetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where itappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may bean operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollarimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just incase there's something you want to do about it.

Exodus is now wrapping upconstructionon a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less thana mile from itsoriginal facility. Sitting at the confluence of severalfiber optic backbones, theExodus plant will consume enough power for a small town andeventuallyhouse Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,Microsoft and Onvia.com.Exodus is not the only company building massive datacenters near Seattle.More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,Globix andHostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will housethe networkingequipment of the Internet economy.It is a big business that could have an effect oneverything from yourmonthly electric bill to the ease with which you accessyour favorite Web sites.Data centers, also known as co-location facilities andserver farms, aresprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the KentValley that somehave expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light andPuget SoundEnergy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,high-securityfacilities.""We are talking to about half a dozen customers thatare requesting 445megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,""said KarlKarzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget SoundEnergy. ""That isthe equivalent of six oil refineries.""A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,the rise of the Internetdata center has some utility veterans scratching theirheads.Puget Sound Energy last week asked the WashingtonUtilities andTransportation Commission to accept a tariff on the newdata centers. Thetariff is designed to protect the company's existingresidential and businesscustomers from footing the bill for the new base stationsnecessary to supportthe projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20million each,Karzmar said.Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans tobring up the data centerissue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.For the utilities that provide power to homes,businesses and schools in theregion, this is a new and complex issue.On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazingappetite for power --represent potentially lucrative business customers. Thefacilities run 24 hours aday, seven days a week, and therefore could become aconstant revenuestream. On the other hand, they require so much energy thatthey couldpotentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capitalexpenditures.Who will pay for those expenditures and what it willmean for power ratesin the area is still open to debate.""These facilities are what we call extremely denseloads,"" said Bob Royer,director of communications and public affairs at SeattleCity Light.""The entire University of Washington, from stadiumlights at the footballgame to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.We have datacenter projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40and 50 megawatts.""With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergatecomplex in Tukwila isone of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchasedthe 1.35 millionsquare-foot Intergate East facility last September fromBoeing Space &Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased92 percent of thesix-building complex to seven different co-locationcompanies.""It is probably the largest data center park in thecountry,"" boasts LaurentPoole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICGCommunications,NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and ZamaNetworks alllease space in the office park.After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,Sabey has become anexpert in the arena and now has facilities either undermanagement ordevelopment in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Pooleclaims his firm isone of the top four builders of Internet data centers inthe country.As more people access the Internet and conductbandwidth-heavy taskssuch as listening to online music, Poole said the need forco-location space inSeattle continues to escalate.But it is not just Seattle. The need for data centerspace is growing at arapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,causing similarconcerns among utilities in places such as Texas andCalifornia.Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-locationspace, plans to nearlydouble the amount of space it has by the end of the year.While companiessuch as Amazon.com run their own server farms, manyhigh-tech companieshave decided to outsource the operations to companies suchas Exodus thatmay be better prepared for dealing with Internet trafficmanagement.""We have 2 million square feet of space underconstruction and we plan todouble our size in the next nine months , yet there is moredemand right nowthan data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an accountexecutive at Exodus inSeattle.The booming market for co-location space has left somein the local utilityindustry perplexed.""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to doto serve the growth,""said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry isalmost stunned by this, ina way."""

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p=ercent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio=n, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on e=quity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively aff=of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the =September 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in c=ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i=nsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination =of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after=-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since=September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl=y, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost=of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th=e company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery =expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra =operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat=ed. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses=will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge inc=ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a=sset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor=ganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i=n certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio=ns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr=ocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec=ted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por=tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=ted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress=on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce=nt. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   ""While we w=ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=estment activity slowed after September 11th,"" said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch=airman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. ""In light of =the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower=our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in=itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business=es with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be=nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in=the economy.""   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a=year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127=million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include=d in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=tacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income =would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=ear.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=e September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=lds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=ncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating=expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=ss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=ing and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results ""=on a managed basis"" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=ich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=lts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=rmats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of=$29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and=therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   Americ=an Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 =million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago.=Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $=62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note=d earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim=s directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net inc=ome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA re=sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on =the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly =lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man=agement and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, exclud=ing the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due=primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-=control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the=company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit=ies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct=ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo=lio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) repo=rted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i=ncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax=($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi=ng these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximate=ly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB s=ustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks=, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co=sts did not impact AEB's quarterly results.   AEB's business results reflec=t strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Re=sults also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses =as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi=gher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan b=alances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues =to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking.   Co=rporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 m=illion a year ago.

1794,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/26/2001It looks like a deal with the non gas fired QFs is iminent.  One for the gasgenerators is still quite a ways off.The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and revertingback to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give backI would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat ratewould be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any timesoon.I will keep you abreast of developments.C---------------------- Forwarded by Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT on 01/26/2001Susan J Mara@ENRONPhillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, JeffDasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, James DSteffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron, PaulKaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECTRE;  Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest versionof the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentiallycomplete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed withthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (ofwhat, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs whoswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for theQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December(and maybe earlier).PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take theForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to getsome assurances of payment.SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are dueon 2/2/01.For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E'spurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can beresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on thisoccurred today.Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much willhappen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .

Also try selecting Fit to one page if you wantyour print out to be on only one page.

1928,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/25/2001Ray Alvarez@ENRONPhil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closeddoors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners thenamong FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely thatthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in largepart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at whichthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairmanbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment oranswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert hadPrice caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reducedemand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they wouldexport California's problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a prettystrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissionerout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda andif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off theagenda.  Hope this info helps.  RayPhillip K Allen@ECTAre there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixedprice gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?"

1128,"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City StarAs natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York MercantileExchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gasstorage number.The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and theforecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated asupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson,a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas.""But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American GasAssociation's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled thestorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view thenumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker thanreality.""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand whatwe are reporting,"" McGill said.As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointingfingers at Wall Street.Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recentlystepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators forthe rise in gas prices.""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adiktold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electricutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blamefor this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect theircustomers and constituents from such price spikes.Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to takeprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of priceinsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gasprices before they soared.""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said PaulSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs tochange,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy SecurityAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.Hot topicmany circles, little else is discussed.The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City isfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double theprevious December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills aswell.The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part ofhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financialpledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said.A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 perthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhileto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid bycustomers.But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousandcubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storagefor winter.There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November,prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy InformationAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heatingbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gasmarkets.""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New Yorktraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatilecommodity in the world.Setting the priceIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price ofgas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began tradingcontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon hadwidespread influence over gas prices.The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soonas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in saleprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, fromutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in whatthey pay for the gas they expect to use.There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intentionof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledgeof natural gas.But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need toknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like allfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds totheir volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of moneyin a short time.As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was lessthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10.Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association'sweekly storage numbers.Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect toneed in the winter.Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less thanaverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, inhopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would besufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, theconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storagenumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said theassociation's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vicepresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap hadcontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.""I was getting worried,"" he said.Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer.Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures pricesdropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.Just passing throughSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase butpass their fuel costs on to customers.Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gascharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri GasEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said lastmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little couldbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserveenergy.Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected tosave an average customer about $25 this winter.Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek anextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would notguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have leftcustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whetherthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuelcosts.On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the PublicCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission toperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices.""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to considersome changes.""To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail toseverly@kcstar.com.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star"

According to BPA,it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meetbiological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so inorder to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it hadbeen telling California's Department of Water Resources that thesales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today thanyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California becauseof concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sendingexchange energy into California, however.More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of theWestern Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter."

I have gathered more information that support myconcerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost aroundUnit Cost, Site work, &builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 millionLand                      1.15Interim Financing               .85Common Areas                     .80Total                         $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unableto get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class Aproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos canproduce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments forlocation and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognizethat Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental ratesthat are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do notbelieve that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement thatwe cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon todiscussalternatives.Phillip"

I wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the frontporch wouldbe smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go aheadand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose abuilder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.

2779,"Jacques,The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry mightobject to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance theconstruction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costsof the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered theloan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount ofequity that would be required.Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items arein a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speakingdirectly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear onwhat is the best way to proceed with these consultants.The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do weneed to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  andgive consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.Phillip"

2821,"George,I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still havethe concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of ourproject are too high.  I have gathered more information that support myconcerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost aroundUnit Cost, Site work, &builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 millionLand                      1.15Interim Financing               .85Common Areas                     .80Total                         $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unableto get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class Aproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos canproduce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments forlocation and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognizethat Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental ratesthat are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do notbelieve that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement thatwe cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon todiscussalternatives.Phillip"

2134,"John,1.  I spoke to John McKay about Sumas.  His views seem well thought out.  He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium.In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book.2.  I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues."

2936,"George,Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and buildersprofit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would berecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 wouldbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as theinvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentionedearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you aspart of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit fromhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase1 complete in November)+5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule-5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, butcould be as favorable as 55/45.

1164,"Steve,I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  Ifyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards salesabove monthly index without enough consideration of futurereplacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should beinjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.This creates a shortage in later months.2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meetdemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in orderto fill storage?2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away toomuch gas from Socal's system.I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting theirown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas thantheir injection capablity, but injected far less.3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to shortterm prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the majorLDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floatingrate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers marketand theconsumer has benefitted.Call me if you need any more input.Phillip"

1786,"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City StarAs natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York MercantileExchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gasstorage number.The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and theforecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated asupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson,a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas.""But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American GasAssociation's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled thestorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view thenumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker thanreality.""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand whatwe are reporting,"" McGill said.As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointingfingers at Wall Street.Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recentlystepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators forthe rise in gas prices.""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adiktold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electricutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blamefor this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect theircustomers and constituents from such price spikes.Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to takeprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of priceinsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gasprices before they soared.""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said PaulSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs tochange,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy SecurityAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.Hot topicmany circles, little else is discussed.The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City isfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double theprevious December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills aswell.The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part ofhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financialpledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said.A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 perthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhileto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid bycustomers.But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousandcubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storagefor winter.There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November,prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy InformationAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heatingbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gasmarkets.""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New Yorktraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatilecommodity in the world.Setting the priceIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price ofgas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began tradingcontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon hadwidespread influence over gas prices.The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soonas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in saleprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, fromutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in whatthey pay for the gas they expect to use.There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intentionof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledgeof natural gas.But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need toknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like allfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds totheir volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of moneyin a short time.As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was lessthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10.Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association'sweekly storage numbers.Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect toneed in the winter.Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less thanaverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, inhopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would besufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, theconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storagenumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said theassociation's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vicepresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap hadcontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.""I was getting worried,"" he said.Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer.Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures pricesdropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.Just passing throughSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase butpass their fuel costs on to customers.Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gascharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri GasEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said lastmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little couldbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserveenergy.Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected tosave an average customer about $25 this winter.Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek anextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would notguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have leftcustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whetherthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuelcosts.On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the PublicCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission toperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices.""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood.

We really need a single point of contact to help drive the traderrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear tobe outside the scope of position consolidation.I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal tomake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with thisproject.

This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) therent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.

435,"Jaques,After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have differentdefinitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of asuperintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to thirdparty subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management""fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would bepaid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finallythe builders profit of 1.4 million.Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers outof the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, ifthey are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in additionto the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have beenin the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates andthe superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction managementfee is included.George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.

If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

2802,"Gentlemen,Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done todate.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property isstill in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lotand is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed atopographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun tocoordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on thesmaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is goingto fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged tocomplete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which$14,000 are due now for work completed.We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred bythe original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we cancontinue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo'snumber is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly andask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your calland he was fine with that.Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by KippFlores can be used.Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left veryoptimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas aboutmoving this project forward.Phillip"

Any possibility for a=deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=us is reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double=dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=ll be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=e would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20=20According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.=20Key Points of the Bridge Financing=09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B=09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 M=09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77%Current Projected=20For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=ier in the crisis.=20SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=the DWR proportionately from rate payments."

2396,"-----Original Message-----Mike & Tony,Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.Phillip Allen713-463-8626"

2712,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/25/2001Ray Alvarez@ENRONPhil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closeddoors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners thenamong FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely thatthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in largepart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at whichthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairmanbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment oranswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert hadPrice caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reducedemand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they wouldexport California's problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a prettystrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissionerout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda andif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off theagenda.  Hope this info helps.  RayPhillip K Allen@ECTAre there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixedprice gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?"

1500,"Pam,Can you help with below?David-----Original Message-----David,For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.Phillip-----Original Message-----For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."

2125,"Jeff,I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter.  Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.  I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.  I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.  The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.  Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.  Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.  The utilities are already in her name.In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.  Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.  Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.  I expect to have that done by Friday.I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.Phillip-----Original Message-----I spoke with Pauline and she says she is ready to transfer the utilities.However, she wants to get your signed permission to transfer their ownershipinterests to the J&P Kuo, Ltd. for purposes of paying back the two notes.(per her attorneys advice).

631,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/19/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

1105,"Jeff,Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance andrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra laborcost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent onrepairs.2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsitemanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager hasinterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male managerthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to amanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manageronsite.3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If youwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structurethis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This propertydefinitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.Sales Price  705,0001st Lien   473,5002nd Lien  225,000Transfer fee    7,500Cash required   14,500NOI   100,0001st Lien    47,2922nd Lien   23,694Cash flow  29,014Cash on cash  200%These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K thencash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect theadditional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few yearsfor a higher price.Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.Phillip"

1809,"Lucy,Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What isgoing on?#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up withemail and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff knowthat he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see theproperty.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can showthem around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay rightnow.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meetbut I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wadecontinue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve theproperty's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better andbetter, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  Itis hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people movein that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  Irealize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor andyour daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and beworking in the office or on the property during office unless you are runningan errand for the property.I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at thistime.  We can look at again later in the year.I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.Phillip"

Heeither needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in themiddle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.

2455,"John,I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended messages.I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation.Please consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning.Phillip"

Through  last Wednesday, when we went to press early b=ecause of the holiday,  31% of the bear market loss from March 27, 2000 to =September 21,  2001 had been recaptured. That's about average for rebounds =in  the postwar period. As shown in the table at the bottom right  of this =week's edition of The Outlook, at the two-month point  in the recoveries fr=om the nine former bear markets since World  War II, the S&P 500 had won ba=ck an average of 33% of the  bear market loss.   In  each of the nine insta=nces, the gain at the end of six months  was greater than that after two mo=nths and the gain at the end  of 12 months was greater than that after six =months. On average,  nearly two-thirds of the bear market loss was recovere=d after  six months and almost all of the bear market loss was recouped  in=a year.  Economic  and corporate news will remain bad for a while, but tha=t's typically  the case in the early part of a bull market that is associat=ed  with an economic recession. Stock prices start recovering well  before =the headlines improve. The September upturn in stocks would  be consistent =with the start of an economic expansion in the first  quarter of next year.=While  P/E ratios currently are high, that won't necessarily keep the  b=ull market from progressing. The preceding economic expansion  was the long=est in history and gave rise to ""new era""  optimism. Corporations, especial=ly in information technology,  built production and sales capacity to level=s far greater than  proved justified. Those excesses are now being correcte=d, painfully.  Corporate earnings are in a severe contraction. Once the eco=nomy  begins to grow again, however, profits will rebound and P/Es will  st=art looking much more reasonable. Low inflation, low interest  rates, rapid=technological innovation and above-average productivity  growth should hel=p support elevated stock valuations.

What isgoing on?#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up withemail and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff knowthat he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see theproperty.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can showthem around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay rightnow.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meetbut I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wadecontinue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve theproperty's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better andbetter, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  Itis hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people movein that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  Irealize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor andyour daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and beworking in the office or on the property during office unless you are runningan errand for the property.I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at thistime.  We can look at again later in the year.I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.Phillip"

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentiallycomplete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed withthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (ofwhat, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs whoswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for theQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December(and maybe earlier).PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take theForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to getsome assurances of payment.SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are dueon 2/2/01.For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E'spurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can beresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.

1218,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/24/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

1498,"--------- Inline attachment follows ---------Mike & Tony,Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.Phillip Allen713-463-8626pallen70@hotmail.com"

In the Southwesttemperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we weresupposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since theweather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.""Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from theEl Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power pricesto fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00.

Temperaturescould climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part ofthe morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expirationthe market had pretty much dried up.""Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the mainreason for the decline in spot market prices.Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to theNew York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per millionBritish thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. SinceMonday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecastsindicated reduced utility load requirements.In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies theynormally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weatherforecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the$67.00-$75.00 range.

Natural gas prices were a large factor in recentelectricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-firedgeneration to meet increased weather-related demand.Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an averageof 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million Britishthermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an averageof 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've gotpeople coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are muchmore realistic prices.""Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if theoutlook for weather continues to be mild.

Adding that other structures willprobably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can moreeasily be assessed.-Nick LivingstoneNordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather ForecastLysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power priceson the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher todayas colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede afterforecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia fornext week. These producers typically generate power to preventreservoirs from overflowing.Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to risewith falling temperatures because of increased requirements forspace heating.Traded volume on the power exchange increased in activetrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traderssaid.""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" aStockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have beenselling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We shouldnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.""Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fallbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limitedchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to WeatherServices Corp. in the U.S.The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand wasexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predicttemperatures to begin falling.Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely riseby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-term contracts.Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner amegawatt-hour.Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, althoughexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producersto meet the increased demand, other traders said.Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who usedtoday's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.-Nick Livingstone=0F$- daily.pdf"

2984,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/28/2000Liane,As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt tomanipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a singlebuyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid abovemarket prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades,offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices werebypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the indexcalculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associatedfinancial swaps for San Juan.We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed fromSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades fromEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokeragefirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for atrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gasdaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greaterthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September andOctober gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices thatare dramatically different.I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, thetrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able todetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades areoutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid inestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from thecalculation of index.It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which toconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact meanytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen"

They do not want the schoolto come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meetwith a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about thesubject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMFwants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan afterthe March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.The Stage is still on go.

We knew that this might upset some clients, but wefound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get ourusers back on-line.We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linkedyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). Thisprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity andconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifyingdata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some ofyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more thanonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) wantdisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (orphone) the information to us and we will remove this information rightaway.During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your billpayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurringpayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become ourhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating theprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter thisinformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for themonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence(and support).Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves andourselves) do not have to go through this process again.

Obviouslyit is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hardto envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.

2573,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 06/12/2000It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  TheWSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposesthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, butthere can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual""generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule theirgeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then youwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern californiamunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simplyschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having saidall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives onthe generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  Whilethey don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number isbetter than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on theload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this withothers up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gasdemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small theUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginalconsumer then it is obviously a different story.Let's talk."

51,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/11/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.Purchase price		1,200,000Fees&Devel costs	  500,000Profit			 400,000The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify.First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?Thank you in advance for your help.Phillip Allen8855 Merlin CtHouston, TX 77055pallen70@hotmail.comwk 713-853-7041hm 713-463-8626"

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000.Pro-Forma                           Bank's AdjustmentUnit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $4753 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $4172.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25xdebtcoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.5.

2136,"Contracts--Privileged and Confidentialjeff,Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.Phillip-----Original Message-----PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.Thanks,Jeff"

Are there any other asset managementtargets in the west?---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/27/2000Jane M TholtAM ---------------------------Laird DyerJanie,Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th todiscuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like togain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What aretypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your maincontacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving ourcontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probablyhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with thecommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from theircommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of monthindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  Thatrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation oftheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatlyappreciated.Thanks,Laird"
1534,"Wow!  this looks complicated.  let me get some help on this and get back to=you-----Original Message-----Greg,After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=f Enron Corp. common stock.There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".=This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=ction 6.3.The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=esRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,65810% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 sharesI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. ==20In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=same issue.

2393,"Greg,After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=f Enron Corp. common stock.There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".=This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=ction 6.3.The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=esRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,65810% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 sharesI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. ==20In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=same issue.

For thesecond, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 peryear, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.?

Why wouldn't I move this money to muni's?Phillip-----Original Message-----Phillip,Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market ( approx.$785,000) for your muni bond portfolio.  After the treasury comes due on Jan31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have to worryabout your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the value ofyour municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the bottomline is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to keep inmind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless you close thatposition you will probably get put those.Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.

1797,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/29/2001George,Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and buildersprofit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would berecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 wouldbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as theinvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentionedearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you aspart of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit fromhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase1 complete in November)+5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule-5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, butcould be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedulemust be discussed and agreed upon.Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626Phillip"
2323,"-----Original Message-----The target for end of October is 1283. We're not sure what's driving the day to day variation. Direct effects of recent precipitation, combined with some very big precip forecast errors, are part of the explanation, but there also appears to be something going on with management of the non-treaty storage that BPA's cached upstream in Arrow. We've been looking into that, and hope to get some news via Technical Management Team today.From a multi-purpose project manager's perspective, I think that current reservoir elevation is one or two feet too high, so I do expect drawdown by month end. I also suspect that there are some limits in the non-treaty storage approaching that require at least partial withdrawal.The net effect should be a rise in production-- no more downstream storage is available and upstream releases will increase, certainly by November 1, but probably earlier.Tim-----Original Message-----Tim,Can you help us with these questions?

1629,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/11/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

What isgoing on?#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up withemail and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff knowthat he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see theproperty.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can showthem around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay rightnow.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meetbut I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wadecontinue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve theproperty's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better andbetter, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  Itis hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people movein that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  Irealize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor andyour daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and beworking in the office or on the property during office unless you are runningan errand for the property.I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at thistime.  We can look at again later in the year.I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.Phillip"

Moderate Arab leaders are concerned that support for attacks at home -- and possible US reactions to strike -- will increase instability and could lead to major upheaval in their countries.  Saudi sources expect ""state of confusion"" to exist for immediate period ahead.In the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than bin Laden was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator.Oil PoliticsOPEC's Rodriguez has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Saudi officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Naimi).  Unofficially, we have reports that Saudi officials reporting that the terrorist incident ""relieves pressure on us to make anti-US moves"" in oil policy."

I wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the frontporch wouldbe smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.

I would like to see some calculations that multiply the net short by the power cost and compare that to the amounts collected through rates.Phillip-----Original Message-----PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIALA source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  Here are the main points from their conversation1.	Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go BankruptCorroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they hadn't already.""  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that ""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.""He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are ""speculative"" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.""2.	Bond Issuance- $12B Not EnoughAngelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the market could handle.""  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.3.	New Generator ConstructionAnglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer."""

331,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/10/2001Enron North America Corp.Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael M Driscoll/PDX/ECT@ECT, ChrisMallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT,Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Bill WilliamsIII/PDX/ECT@ECT, Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECTPhillip et al.,the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demandover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting fortemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translatesinto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) ascompared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntaryreductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Otherforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (makingtotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couplemore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to theretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that itis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to lastyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa inJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservationare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood ofmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the generaleconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at leastmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control areaonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISOportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions indemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  Asyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminumsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off atleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets itswish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Severalmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they aresharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactlyhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif'seconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest ofthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, Ithink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% alreadyrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in thenon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for theWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide youwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, Ihope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have anyquestions or need any further information."

Note that theconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than ourstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairlysure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detachedgarages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.- winmail.dat"

Any possibility for adeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicansand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus isreportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans andDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once thebonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" intothe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature andthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details ofthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-termpower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that thebond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach ofcontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridgeloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be verydifficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the statewould ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the GeneralFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even thisconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for fulldisclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including thedetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before theywill support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This billpassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack ofRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs forcommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may beamended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state shouldget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would belikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to moneyavailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has statedthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  TheRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary andthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.Key Points of the Bridge FinancingLehman Brothers  $1.0 BBear Stearns  $625 MTax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current ProjectedFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create theCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billionauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must beauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or theadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasingpower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of theseauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts thegovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bondamount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay tosupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paidfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. forthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this canbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting thisidea  earlier in the crisis.SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  Thefirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and thegovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU isAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  Accordingto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal hassigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davisand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicatesthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntarybankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bondissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, thestate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included andpassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file forbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities andthe DWR proportionately from rate payments."
1659,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/09/2000Richard BurchfieldPhillip,Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting therequirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transporttrade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood.

We've hadthree meetings which brought out very different issues from differenttraders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the traderrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear tobe outside the scope of position consolidation.I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal tomake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with thisproject.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for thisproject and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each andwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and dealticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns thatadd up existing position manager rows/columns).transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time valuesof all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to beshown directly above monthly positions.

Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or someprice that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are largeenough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to managethe price risk.

1812,"Jeff,I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are severalreasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, thelarge cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyerare the three biggest concerns.What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over thebuyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come dueuntil September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold theproperty.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to makethe deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinanceis pushing too far.Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day theearnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.

167,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 06/12/2000It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  TheWSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposesthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, butthere can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual""generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule theirgeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then youwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern californiamunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simplyschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having saidall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives onthe generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  Whilethey don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number isbetter than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on theload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this withothers up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gasdemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small theUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginalconsumer then it is obviously a different story.Let's talk."

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood.

We've hadthree meetings which brought out very different issues from differenttraders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the traderrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear tobe outside the scope of position consolidation.I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal tomake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with thisproject.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for thisproject and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each andwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and dealticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns thatadd up existing position manager rows/columns).transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time valuesof all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to beshown directly above monthly positions.

617,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.

462,"Jacques,Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting asolid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutescosts.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and Iwould like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to faxall invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to thechecking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearingbut invoices were not being submitted.Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need sometweaking.Phillip Allen713-853-7041pallen@enron.com"

I was going for a simplefarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  Morecabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.Reagansuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the frontporch wouldbe smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go aheadand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose abuilder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentionedmy alternative is $0.60/ft.

2247,"Greg,This spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply & demand in San Marcos by unit.  Next, I want to look at the numbers by bedroom.  Let's compare numbers.1.	Unit mixes of all proposed projects.2.	Completion date of  Blazer Development (220), Capstone (270), Melrose (202), Bonner-Carr. (186)3.	Is the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds?This spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005.  San Marcos will have over 6,000 units.  If the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5%.  That would not be a disaster.Tomorrow, I would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data.Let me know what you think.Phillip"

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demandover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting fortemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translatesinto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) ascompared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntaryreductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Otherforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (makingtotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couplemore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to theretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that itis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to lastyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa inJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservationare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood ofmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the generaleconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at leastmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control areaonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISOportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions indemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  Asyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminumsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off atleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets itswish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Severalmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they aresharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactlyhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif'seconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest ofthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, Ithink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% alreadyrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in thenon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for theWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide youwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, Ihope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have anyquestions or need any further information."
2988,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

Any possibility for adeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicansand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus isreportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans andDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once thebonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" intothe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature andthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details ofthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-termpower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that thebond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach ofcontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridgeloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be verydifficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the statewould ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the GeneralFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even thisconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for fulldisclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including thedetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before theywill support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This billpassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack ofRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs forcommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may beamended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state shouldget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would belikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to moneyavailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has statedthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  TheRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary andthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.Key Points of the Bridge FinancingLehman Brothers  $1.0 BBear Stearns  $625 MTax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current ProjectedFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create theCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billionauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must beauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or theadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasingpower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of theseauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts thegovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bondamount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay tosupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paidfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. forthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this canbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting thisidea  earlier in the crisis.SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  Thefirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and thegovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU isAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  Accordingto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal hassigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davisand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicatesthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntarybankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bondissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, thestate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included andpassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file forbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities andthe DWR proportionately from rate payments."

604,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/09/2000Richard BurchfieldPhillip,Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting therequirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transporttrade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but nowwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000Allan SeverudeMills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECTFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidatedWe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've hadthree meetings which brought out very different issues from differenttraders.

2051,"MichelleHere are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).SheriWhen you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a ""Dateline"" type theme for one, and a ""60 Minute"" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?Cheers KirkKirk McDanielMichelleThanks for your support of the BRM project. Here are the remaining scripts. Tim and I will review them too and forward our comments to you. Any feedback on the first two scripts? Again, Thanks!!CheersKirkKirk -I have combined all of the storyline scripts (Intro and Scenarios 1-7) foryou to send to Legal for their review. Your comments were incorporated inthe scripts for scenarios 1 and 2.  We decided to refer to the company asboth Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. so thatthere is no confusion with Enron International. We will not have a coachexit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood.

When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.

640,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/11/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

The San Marcos Ci=ty Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two =Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 squa=re mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable a=nd appropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affe=cting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corne=r of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  We=atherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of vari=ous city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner say=s were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two =plan.  Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no dir=ect effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density resid=ential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of=commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven a=dditional acres of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight a=cres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is su=ggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing=development in the revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of co=mmercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to ""community commerci=al"" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ens=ure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete wit=h buffering and landscaping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed t=o separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan. =However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew som=e concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may po=se on the busy state highway.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing th=e proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Ave=nue.  While the state highway department and city would have input into the=plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron=Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between=the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.  Council member Jane Hughso=n supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sect=or Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in th=e area as development proceeds.  ""I'd rather say ""no' and if someone comes =us with a really good idea, look at it then,"" Hughson said.  Councilman Ed =Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of th=e curb cut.  ""It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happe=n there,"" Mihalkanin said.  A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclud=e curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San =Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting =against the move. Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the=meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from severa=l residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good =compromise.  Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active crit=ic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concernin=g the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests =of the city as a whole.  ""This is not a victory for one side or the other,""=said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to=Weatherford's initial plans for his property, ""but a victory for the City =of San Marcos. We started out with all R-1...we've come a long way."" =09=20"

Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS,TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all theparties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS andTAGG but the issues facingscheduling in Unify are grey.2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up""policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals needfurther      scrutiny.3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physicalimbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design trainingcourses, review progress and make cuts.5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking ateverything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should addsome value and direction to the group.In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MDto work part time to get it done.Phillip"
460,"Lucy,Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bankis showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on thespreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?6.  #14  missed on 2/2?7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?8.  #20a missed on 2/2?9.  #35 missed on 2/2?My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember onsome of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to thebank deposit.Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.

Please advise why this is so difficult for you.Thanks,Bill-----Original Message-----Matt,As we discussed several times previously, including earlier this week, Nine Energy Services LLC is a CREDIT WATCH COUNTERPARTY and a WMBE (Women and Minority owned Business Enterprises), which means that ALL trades need to be approved by Credit and documented with a Resale Agreement. Every time we transact, ENA's Confirmation Group needs to know from whom to expect payment, i.e. San Diego Gas & Electric. The nature of the transaction exposes ENA to secondary risk with the ultimate counterparty. On another note, some transactions COULD be declined by Credit due to direct exposure/risk that the ENA has with the Counterparty, outside of any WMBE Transactions.Sitara Deal Number 1014433 was another violation of Corporate Credit Policy. In the future, please contact Credit before transacting with any Credit Watch Counterparty.-Darren Vanek"

Thus you have to pay as little as possible, increasethe cash flow (i.e.-renovations), to compete with the quality of newconstruction.

26,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""

As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus.

In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.

1441,"Thanks.  That is an interesting idea.  I'd like to keep the rear stairwaybut that might still be possible.  Anyway, let's see what happens with thevariance.  I appreciate your efforts.By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors?Bob----- Original Message -----Bob,I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will beon January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing,the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impressionthat yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some usefulsuggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the additionforward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the newspace.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and usethe new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off theexisting play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room thatis bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could beused for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you wouldnot have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert theplayroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you couldslope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place alarge dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.>From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as yourdrawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area belowthe addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to thedriveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the houseso that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchento the living room or dining room would still be possible.

Who would you recommend starting out of Duce =Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answe=r - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agai=nst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a=nd three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously=not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have t=o go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so =going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To a=nswer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol=ina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but=Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at=best, so our hands are tied.  =09Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=is week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=e. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be =facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=ig game.  =09non Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=ailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i=n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not =good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=other No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=ntasy player.  =09giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves?

Morecabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.Reagansuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the frontporch wouldbe smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go aheadand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose abuilder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.

1667,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/24/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Callwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.Sincerely,George RichardsPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC- winmail.dat"

1868,"Gentlemen,Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done todate.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property isstill in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lotand is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed atopographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun tocoordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on thesmaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is goingto fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged tocomplete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which$14,000 are due now for work completed.We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred bythe original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we cancontinue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo'snumber is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly andask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your calland he was fine with that.Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by KippFlores can be used.Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left veryoptimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas aboutmoving this project forward.Phillip"

1443,"I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.Ken Lay"

Temperaturescould climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part ofthe morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expirationthe market had pretty much dried up.""Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the mainreason for the decline in spot market prices.Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to theNew York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per millionBritish thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. SinceMonday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecastsindicated reduced utility load requirements.In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies theynormally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weatherforecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the$67.00-$75.00 range.

Natural gas prices were a large factor in recentelectricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-firedgeneration to meet increased weather-related demand.Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an averageof 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million Britishthermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an averageof 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've gotpeople coming to their senses,"" one trader said.

Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede afterforecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia fornext week. These producers typically generate power to preventreservoirs from overflowing.Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to risewith falling temperatures because of increased requirements forspace heating.Traded volume on the power exchange increased in activetrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traderssaid.""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" aStockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have beenselling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We shouldnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.""Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fallbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limitedchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to WeatherServices Corp. in the U.S.The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand wasexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predicttemperatures to begin falling.Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely riseby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-term contracts.Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner amegawatt-hour.Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, althoughexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producersto meet the increased demand, other traders said.Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who usedtoday's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.-Nick Livingstone=0F$- daily.pdf"

Ihave been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at thedistribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required forpower quality reasons.The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year dueto server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farmtrying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 monthsdue to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand,Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rudeawakening in the next 2-3 years.---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000Enron North America Corp.Broderick/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey Miller/NA/Enron@EnronPM ---------------------------George HopleyCOMMUNICATIONS@ENRONInternet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain onLocal Utilities( September 05, 2000 )In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called ExodusCommunications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center inTukwila.The mission was to handle the Internet traffic andcomputer servers for theregion's growing number of dot-coms.Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping upconstructionon a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less thana mile from itsoriginal facility. Sitting at the confluence of severalfiber optic backbones, theExodus plant will consume enough power for a small town andeventuallyhouse Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,Microsoft and Onvia.com.Exodus is not the only company building massive datacenters near Seattle.More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,Globix andHostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will housethe networkingequipment of the Internet economy.It is a big business that could have an effect oneverything from yourmonthly electric bill to the ease with which you accessyour favorite Web sites.Data centers, also known as co-location facilities andserver farms, aresprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the KentValley that somehave expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light andPuget SoundEnergy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,high-securityfacilities.""We are talking to about half a dozen customers thatare requesting 445megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,""said KarlKarzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget SoundEnergy. ""That isthe equivalent of six oil refineries.""A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,the rise of the Internetdata center has some utility veterans scratching theirheads.Puget Sound Energy last week asked the WashingtonUtilities andTransportation Commission to accept a tariff on the newdata centers. Thetariff is designed to protect the company's existingresidential and businesscustomers from footing the bill for the new base stationsnecessary to supportthe projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20million each,Karzmar said.Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans tobring up the data centerissue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.For the utilities that provide power to homes,businesses and schools in theregion, this is a new and complex issue.On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazingappetite for power --represent potentially lucrative business customers. Thefacilities run 24 hours aday, seven days a week, and therefore could become aconstant revenuestream. On the other hand, they require so much energy thatthey couldpotentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capitalexpenditures.Who will pay for those expenditures and what it willmean for power ratesin the area is still open to debate.""These facilities are what we call extremely denseloads,"" said Bob Royer,director of communications and public affairs at SeattleCity Light.""The entire University of Washington, from stadiumlights at the footballgame to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.We have datacenter projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40and 50 megawatts.""With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergatecomplex in Tukwila isone of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchasedthe 1.35 millionsquare-foot Intergate East facility last September fromBoeing Space &Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased92 percent of thesix-building complex to seven different co-locationcompanies.""It is probably the largest data center park in thecountry,"" boasts LaurentPoole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICGCommunications,NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and ZamaNetworks alllease space in the office park.After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,Sabey has become anexpert in the arena and now has facilities either undermanagement ordevelopment in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Pooleclaims his firm isone of the top four builders of Internet data centers inthe country.As more people access the Internet and conductbandwidth-heavy taskssuch as listening to online music, Poole said the need forco-location space inSeattle continues to escalate.But it is not just Seattle. The need for data centerspace is growing at arapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,causing similarconcerns among utilities in places such as Texas andCalifornia.Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-locationspace, plans to nearlydouble the amount of space it has by the end of the year.While companiessuch as Amazon.com run their own server farms, manyhigh-tech companieshave decided to outsource the operations to companies suchas Exodus thatmay be better prepared for dealing with Internet trafficmanagement.""We have 2 million square feet of space underconstruction and we plan todouble our size in the next nine months , yet there is moredemand right nowthan data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an accountexecutive at Exodus inSeattle.The booming market for co-location space has left somein the local utilityindustry perplexed.""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to doto serve the growth,""said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry isalmost stunned by this, ina way."""

""It makes the market for natural gas.""But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American GasAssociation's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled thestorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view thenumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker thanreality.""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand whatwe are reporting,"" McGill said.As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointingfingers at Wall Street.Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recentlystepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators forthe rise in gas prices.""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adiktold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electricutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blamefor this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect theircustomers and constituents from such price spikes.Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to takeprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of priceinsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gasprices before they soared.""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said PaulSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs tochange,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy SecurityAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.Hot topicmany circles, little else is discussed.The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City isfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double theprevious December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills aswell.The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part ofhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financialpledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said.A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 perthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhileto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid bycustomers.But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousandcubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storagefor winter.There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November,prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy InformationAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heatingbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gasmarkets.""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New Yorktraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatilecommodity in the world.Setting the priceIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price ofgas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began tradingcontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon hadwidespread influence over gas prices.The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soonas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in saleprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, fromutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in whatthey pay for the gas they expect to use.There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intentionof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledgeof natural gas.But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need toknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like allfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds totheir volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of moneyin a short time.As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was lessthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10.Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association'sweekly storage numbers.Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect toneed in the winter.Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less thanaverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, inhopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would besufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, theconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storagenumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said theassociation's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vicepresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap hadcontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.""I was getting worried,"" he said.Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer.Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures pricesdropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.Just passing throughSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase butpass their fuel costs on to customers.Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gascharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri GasEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said lastmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little couldbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserveenergy.Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected tosave an average customer about $25 this winter.Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek anextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would notguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have leftcustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whetherthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuelcosts.On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the PublicCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission toperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices.""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to considersome changes.""To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail toseverly@kcstar.com.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star"

Depending on how much we want to buy, we would definitely look atdifferent issues. What I can do is come up with a proposal tomorrow and workthe ladder with the dates you provided below. Just let me know about howmuch we want to start off with.Steve-----Original Message-----What are the specifics of those bonds are they insured what are they rated?Can you work up a ladder from 2015-2026?  Shouldn't I buy more than justone or two issues?-----Original Message-----You are correct.  With your tax bracket a 5% muni would be theequivalent ofan 8.2% taxable yield.  I looked at the inventory.  Right know we haveonly180 bonds of a San Jacinto Community with a YTM of 4.92% maturing2022.Also, a Lubbock Texas Heath Facility with a YTM of 5.1% maturing 2023.Letme know what you think.Steve-----Original Message-----I would like to achieve a yield of 5%.  I am expecting an averagematuritydate of 2020.Since the treasury is only paying 6.25% taxable at 39%, isn't theeffectiveyield only 3.8%?  Why wouldn't I move this money to muni's?Phillip-----Original Message-----@ENRONPhillip,Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market (approx.$785,000) for your muni bond portfolio.  After the treasury comesdueon Jan31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't havetoworryabout your margin requirements because you still get  80% of thevalueofyour municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, thebottomline is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing tokeepinmind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless youclosethatposition you will probably get put those.Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.Also,ifthere are any specifics that you want me to consider with yourproposal suchas duration, maturity, etc.Steve******************************************************Please do not transmit orders and/or instructionsregarding your UBSPaineWebber account(s) by e-mail.Orders and/or instructions transmitted by e-mail willnot be accepted by UBSPaineWebber and UBSPaineWebberwill not be responsible for carrying out such ordersand/or instructions.UBSPaineWebber reserves the right to monitor andreview the content of all e-mail communications sentand/or received by its employees.**********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevantaffiliate andmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use oftheintended recipient (s).

The principal change is in theaddition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate willcosts at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costshave been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more thansufficient, but there will be additional updates.The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&Ntotal of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit andoffice is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in asa rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanentmortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for theconstruction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when thisloan is obtained.Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, theconstruction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.George W.

348,"Cary,Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simplefarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  Morecabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.Reagansuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the frontporch wouldbe smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go aheadand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose abuilder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentionedmy alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailedsketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reaganallowed.Phillip Allen713-853-7041---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/29/2001Hunter S Shively"

1028,"George,I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still havethe concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of ourproject are too high.  I have gathered more information that support myconcerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost aroundUnit Cost, Site work, &builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 millionLand                      1.15Interim Financing               .85Common Areas                     .80Total                         $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unableto get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class Aproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos canproduce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments forlocation and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognizethat Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental ratesthat are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do notbelieve that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement thatwe cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon todiscussalternatives.Phillip"

647,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/08/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..

Pauline is stilltrying to get them to move forward.I spoke with their attorney this AM, and he said that he is reviewing thesettlement document and will like to get everything settled before he leaveson vacation. (even though he has had the document for a month?)I suggested that he talk to Jacques to speed the process up.  Pauline mayhave been slowing the process by not giving him info.You should probably have Jacques speak with their attorney (Kolb) if he doesnot make contact by tomorrow.Also, Pauline wants to know if you have any info. on a contact name for thepay phone.Call me if you need anything.Jeff> -----Original Message----->>> Jacques,>> Have you received the assignment letter from Marcus Kolb.

2891,"George,The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shiftedto a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I couldnot work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning moretowards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  Onewing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage +guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  Thisplan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with thecourtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoorliving.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglassskylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to havesingle slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I wouldlike to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, Iwould like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  Iwould like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one wedidn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work)Phillip AllenPS.  Channel 2 in Houston ran a story yesterday (Feb. 2) about a home inKingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls.

I have also attached anextremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see evenreducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would onlygenerate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled aboutsuch a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost downto $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.

That's great.We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.What's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bikeriding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just onmaintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanaticalcyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.He never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in MemorialPark on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on theroad.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.I would like to hear more about your new job.

Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60existed at the time of this bid.Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on aboveI am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.

As it is a major project for a firm ofour size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed orrejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.?Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on apercentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based onyour prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%,or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For thesecond, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 peryear, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of thesevaluations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes theforfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, inthe hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of futureprojects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 permonth to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.?

24,"Liane,As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt tomanipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered themarketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At thetime of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades toreport into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out ofline with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed fromSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades fromEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokeragefirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for atrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gasdaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greaterthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September andOctober gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces thatare dramatically different.I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, thetrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able todetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades areoutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid inestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from thecalculation of index.It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which toconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact meanytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen"

2811,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/08/2001---------------------- Forwarded by Andrew M Ozuna/TX/BANCONE on 03/07/2001Andrew M OzunaGeorge,Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for theSagewoodPhase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.

In preparation for that meeting we would like togain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What aretypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your maincontacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving ourcontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probablyhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with thecommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from theircommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of monthindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  Thatrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.

1141,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/17/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that theconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than ourstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairlysure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3bedroom.

25,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demandover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting fortemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translatesinto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) ascompared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntaryreductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Otherforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (makingtotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couplemore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to theretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that itis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to lastyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa inJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservationare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood ofmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the generaleconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at leastmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control areaonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISOportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions indemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  Asyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminumsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off atleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets itswish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Severalmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they aresharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactlyhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif'seconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest ofthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, Ithink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% alreadyrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in thenon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for theWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide youwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, Ihope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have anyquestions or need any further information."

It is  too vague and it doesn't sound likeanything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estateclosing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.??If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there isno point in me  following up on this?document's validity.??I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there andfind out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.?I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordabledocument or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.?This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone lastnight but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he saidthis is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.??I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look atthat but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is evenneeded to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is anyneed to contact me regarding the  closing.?I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myselfand I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn'tseem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need mysignature on something like this I would rather have  time to have itreviewed before I accept it.?Brenda??"

As he did not have the funds to take on theland himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would liketo proceed and develop the property.My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I wouldalso like to compare construction and development services between what youcan do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems tobe in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architecturalwork to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer isQuattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion abouteither.I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.Phillip"

I am pulling together the partnership agreement and other organizational documents.  Let me know what else I need to do.I received the final geotech report yesterday.  Let me know what this means.  It did not look good to me.  Crazy amounts of fill and still nowhere near a PVR of 1"".Bobincheck got me all fired up about HUD being out of money yesterday.  Darrell calmed me down somewhat, but should we go ahead and submit a package to Bank One just in case?Still need to look at the numbers once again.  Email when ready.Talk to you soon.Phillip"

I was going for a simplefarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  Morecabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.Reagansuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the frontporch wouldbe smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go aheadand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose abuilder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentionedmy alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailedsketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reaganallowed.Phillip Allen713-853-7041---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/29/2001Hunter S Shively- F828FA00.PDF"
94,"Alan ComnesPhillip,I got this request.  On the gas side, I think Kean/Lay need an update to a table you prepared for me a few months ago, which I've attached..  Can you oblige?  Thanks,Alan ComnesJanel Guerrero@ENRONAlan,Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?"
770,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/30/2000Phillip--I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strangeto me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not bean issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this isO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me toget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know andI'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygatecurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of$235,019.(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change youroverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affectssomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)GDP-Kingsgate.Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see fivedifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be forwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as aQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means isthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transportlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have asystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seemsthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's thedetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where itappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may bean operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollarimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just incase there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show thevolumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.Deal #  251327                  159540                   265229106300   201756P&L  $29,503                ($15,960)                ($3,199)($2,769)   ($273)Gr RvrBasin/0852   Ques/Clay Basin    Ques/Clay Basin1        329       8,7382     1,5003         2,974    11,3624         6,741    12,349       1,4395       19,052          3,1839            33313  30,863       2,68014  30,45115  35,22616         6,979              23517  17,46418    9,29420  10,796          77121  17,93022  10,66723       14,415          9,07625  23,934       8,69526     3,28427         1,97628     1,75129     1,59130  20,242"

2059,"Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.I have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you.

1966,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 06/12/2000It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  TheWSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposesthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, butthere can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual""generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule theirgeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then youwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern californiamunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simplyschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having saidall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives onthe generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  Whilethey don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number isbetter than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on theload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this withothers up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gasdemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small theUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginalconsumer then it is obviously a different story.Let's talk."

They do not want the schoolto come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meetwith a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about thesubject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMFwants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan afterthe March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.The Stage is still on go.

388,"Gentlemen,Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done todate.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property isstill in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lotand is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed atopographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun tocoordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on thesmaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is goingto fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged tocomplete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which$14,000 are due now for work completed.We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred bythe original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we cancontinue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo'snumber is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly andask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your calland he was fine with that.Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by KippFlores can be used.Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left veryoptimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas aboutmoving this project forward.Phillip"

Shouldn't I buy more than just one or two issues?-----Original Message-----You are correct.  With your tax bracket a 5% muni would be the equivalent ofan 8.2% taxable yield.  I looked at the inventory.  Right know we have only180 bonds of a San Jacinto Community with a YTM of 4.92% maturing 2022.Also, a Lubbock Texas Heath Facility with a YTM of 5.1% maturing 2023.  Letme know what you think.Steve-----Original Message-----I would like to achieve a yield of 5%.  I am expecting an average maturitydate of 2020.Since the treasury is only paying 6.25% taxable at 39%, isn't the effectiveyield only 3.8%?  Why wouldn't I move this money to muni's?Phillip-----Original Message-----Phillip,Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market ( approx.$785,000) for your muni bond portfolio.  After the treasury comes dueon Jan31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have toworryabout your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the valueofyour municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, thebottomline is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to keepinmind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless you closethatposition you will probably get put those.Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.

2973,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/09/2000Richard BurchfieldPhillip,Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting therequirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transporttrade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood.

We've hadthree meetings which brought out very different issues from differenttraders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the traderrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear tobe outside the scope of position consolidation.I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal tomake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with thisproject.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for thisproject and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each andwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and dealticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns thatadd up existing position manager rows/columns).transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time valuesof all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to beshown directly above monthly positions.

The only paymentthat George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have writtenpersonal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to theengineer.I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of thepartnership.I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with thepartnership not with me.

Cash NeedsSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=plete=20cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=s=20and other measures.=20Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=.8=20million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II. Credit RelationshipsSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20extend or renew credit as it has become due.At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=lt.=20Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=nd=20payable.SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond==20indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =its=20rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade==20issues within the last three weeks.III. Energy Cost ScenariosHighlightsThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=such=20scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV. Cost Containment InitiativesHighlightsSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital==20Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77Capital Improvement Costs                383Total                                             $ 460The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to==20be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=om=20contract employees.Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the==20most part being deferred to a future date.SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20savings of approximately $92 million.V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=e=20end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit==20balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=RN=20to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=s.=20The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=t=20would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=ift=20costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=the=20revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =in=20the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII.

1653,"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/28/2000Liane,As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt tomanipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a singlebuyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid abovemarket prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades,offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices werebypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the indexcalculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associatedfinancial swaps for San Juan.We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed fromSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades fromEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokeragefirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for atrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gasdaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greaterthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September andOctober gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices thatare dramatically different.I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, thetrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able todetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades areoutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid inestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from thecalculation of index.It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which toconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact meanytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen"
